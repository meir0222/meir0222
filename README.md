I'm passionate about reverse engineering, exploit development, and vulnerability research. I enjoy breaking things down, understanding how they work, and finding creative ways to push their limits.

## About Me

I'm currently diving deep into vulnerability research, focusing on exploit development and reversing. My goal is to push my skills further and contribute to the security community by discovering and understanding vulnerabilities.

## What I Do

* 💡  Conduct in-depth security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and potential risks.
* 🔐 Develop and implement cybersecurity strategies, policies, rules, and procedures to protect the organization's systems, networks, and data.
* 🔬 Collect and analyze malware samples to understand their behavior, capabilities, and potential impact on systems and networks.
* 🔍 Identify and extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from malware samples, such as file names, registry keys, network signatures, and behavior patterns.
* 🔍 Leverage threat intelligence feeds, open-source intelligence, and information from security vendors to stay informed about the latest threats, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), and indicators of compromise.
* 🌐 Stay updated on the latest cybersecurity trends and technologies to enhance knowledge and skills.

## My Goals

  * 🌟 Work as a Security Researcher to explore cutting-edge technologies and contribute to the advancement of cybersecurity.
  * 📚 Expand my knowledge and skills in areas such as vulnerability research, and exploit development.
  * 💻 Engage in bug bounty programs to enhance my practical skills in finding security vulnerabilities.
