I'm passionate about reverse engineering, exploit development, and vulnerability research.
I enjoy breaking things down, understanding how they work, and finding creative ways to push their limits.

## About Me

I'm currently diving deep into vulnerability research, focusing on exploit development and reversing. My goal is to push my skills further by discovering, implementing and understanding vulnerabilities.

## What I Do

* Reverse engineering real world applications and analyzing binaries.
* Developing exploits and exploring security vulnerabilities.
* Studying malware behavior and evasion techniques.

## My Goals

* Keep sharpening my exploit development skills and push my understanding of vulnerabilities even further.
* Master advanced exploit development techniques.
* Contribute to open-source security projects and share research that helps others in the community.
* Take on bug bounty challenges and security competitions to put my skills to the test in real scenarios.
