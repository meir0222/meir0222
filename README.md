I'm passionate about reverse engineering, exploit development, and vulnerability research.
I enjoy breaking things down, understanding how they work, and finding creative ways to push their limits.

## About Me

I'm currently diving deep into vulnerability research, focusing on exploit development and reversing. My goal is to push my skills further and contribute to the security community by discovering and understanding vulnerabilities.

## What I Do

* Reverse engineering real world applications and analyzing binaries.
* Developing exploits and exploring security vulnerabilities.
* Studying malware behavior and evasion techniques.

## My Goals

* Keep sharpening my exploit development skills and push my understanding of vulnerabilities even further.
* Master advanced exploit development techniques.
* Contribute to open-source security projects and share research that helps others in the community.
* Take on bug bounty challenges and security competitions to put my skills to the test in real scenarios.
